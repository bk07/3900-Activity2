This is a basic web page created using html and css.
The first page to opened is a.html ; which opens the first html page of Bhargav Kishore.
Then you can follow the link given in that page "OPEN".
This redirects to second html page of Dr. Sandra Vlasnik.
The path is already set.
I used Embedded and Inline CSS for each web page of html and there is no external file.
The Embedded and Inline CSS I used takes Style tag, so It would be sufficient for our Web page.
